          At a press conference, the Hong Kong Government has 
          announced the suspension of the Extradition Bill. 
          But on a legal level, the word "suspension" does not 
          have any legal binding power which causing Hongkongers still
          depressed about this announcement.
          On the same day, a teenager committed suicide. 
          He was holding up a sign about the Anti Extradition 
          Bill before falling off a building.
